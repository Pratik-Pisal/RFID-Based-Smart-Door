# RFID Based Smart Door

## Overview

The RFID Based Smart Door is an ESP32-powered access control and automation project designed to provide secure and intelligent door operation. The system integrates RFID authentication, motion sensing, and an automatic sliding door mechanism to deliver a modern access control solution.

This project demonstrates the application of embedded systems, automation, motor control, and smart home technologies in a real-world scenario.

## System Working

1. The user authenticates using a registered RFID card.
2. The ESP32 verifies the RFID credentials.
3. The solenoid lock is released.
4. The system becomes active for automatic door operation.
5. The PIR sensor detects motion and triggers door movement.
6. The BTS7960 motor driver controls the sliding door mechanism.
7. Limit switches monitor fully open and fully closed positions.
8. Audio feedback is provided through the JQ6500 module.
9. System status is stored in EEPROM to maintain operation after power interruptions.
10. OTA updates allow wireless firmware upgrades.
